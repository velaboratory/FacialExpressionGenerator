July 28
Aligh the lipmarks
Make the csv file works
generate the data
make a customize data loader with mark coordinates
train
test


July 26
test on new trained model with real leap data with pencat model

swith to landmark

July 25
retrain the model with the new data



July 21
added another dataset to mimic pico view
|stored under output/pic|
with variation:
=> light intensity = 0.85  
=> hmd.location + new Vector3(0f, -0.008f, +0.004f)
=> HMDloction.transform.eulerAngles = Vector3.zero
=> insert "_r0_" in each file name for naming. 
maybe not like pico that much. because the model is oculus quest 2
maybe need a pico

July 14th
re-run last time


July 10th
intented to add more variation data to make it more tolerant and robust
1st more set data |stored under output/low|
with variation:
=> light intensity = 0.8 (actual test suggested low lightness)
=> HMDloction.transform.eulerAngles = new Vector3(0.01f, 0.01f, 0.01f) //random variation
=> insert "_r0_" in each file name for naming. 
crashed



July 6th
tried 5 categories, not bad, but not good decently robusted!

July 5th
added more data |stored under output/lab| based on me myself with quest 2:
adjusted the leapmotion pos Vector3(0,-0.06,0.028) previously z=0.02613
with variation:
=> hmd.location + Vector3(0f, +0.002f, +0.0017f)
=> hmd.rotation: zero! 
=> light intensity = 1.0
=> insert "_q2_" in each file name for naming. this data taylored for quest 2

July 1st 
tried five categories


June 30th
added more data |stored under output/cat| with rotation variation 
about to label five categories with different level open of mouth
with variation:
=> hmd.pos + Vector3(0f, +0.005f, -0.003f) //higher than previously
=> HMDloction.transform.eulerAngles = new Vector3(0.02f, 0.02f, 0.02f) //random variation
=> light intensity = 1.0


June 24th
added lips markers: 4 upperlipbot, underliptop.
the pytorch raw data preprocessing with PIL RGB<-->LeapUVC stream with CV2 or any CV2 loading


June 23rd

#recollect data 
using 1.1 light intensity 
added more data |stored under output/var| based on me myself with quest 1:
with variation hmd.pos + Vector3(0f, -0.005f, 0.005f) 
LEDS ANGLE, 140 




June 22ND

#recollect data |stored under output/new|
using 0.9 light intensity 
with taylored hmd 
test on leap stream data. bad!

ask machine learning to find marker.
find nasal to restrict the rest like lips...


4 mark upperlipbot, underliptop.

June 17th




project landmarks to cam 2d 

collect data

run resnet18 on new data with landmarks

test on real leap data



June 16th

Pilot Female 02 , Business Female 01 are the same. LITTLE EYELASH DIFFER! REMOVED PiloTF02!



June 15th

36 landmarks: contour of face, nose T zone, lips.
add it all.
